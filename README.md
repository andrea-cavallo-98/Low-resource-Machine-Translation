# Low-resource-Machine-Translation

This repository contains the code for the project relative to the course `Deep Natural Language Processing`. The goal of the project is to replicate the experiments performed by [Dabre et al.](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1146.pdf) on low-resource machine translation. In particular, starting from a machine translation model pretrained on a large dataset, we finetune it on a low-resource language. Then, two extensions are implemented:
* The same approach is tested on translation from Vietnamese to English and, then, from English to the other low-resource languages
* The same approach is tested on a different dataset and a different language pair

The initial model chosen for the task is MarianMT, a transformer-based model pretrained on a large English-Chinese corpus. The model is finetuned on three low-resource languages from the [ALT dataset](https://www2.nict.go.jp/astrec-att/member/mutiyama/ALT/) (Vietnamese, Indonesian and Filipino). The finetuning is performed using the [Huggingface ðŸ¤— Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index).

### Changing direction of translation

For this task, the initial model is MarianMT pretrained on a Chinese-English corpus. The model is finetuned on the Vietnamese-Chinese task, then the English sentences are translated to another low-resource language using the models finetuned in the previous part. The results are assessed by computing the BLEU score.

### Testing on a different dataset

In this task, the approach is experimented on the [WikiMatrix](https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER/tree/main/tasks/WikiMatrix) dataset, which consists on many parallel sentences mined from Wikipedia using a distance metric to predict alignments. The selected language pair is English-Kazakh because it contains the same number of samples as those in the previous sections. The starting model is MarianMT pretrained on English-Turkish, and results are evaluated using the BLEU score.
